# Model Mondays S2E9: Building Models for AI Agents

Welcome to Episode 9! This week, we dove deep into the world of agentic AI—how to build, configure, and orchestrate AI agents using the latest tools from Azure AI Foundry. We explored new model launches, best practices for agent workflows, and saw a real-world customer demo from Atomic Work, showing how agents can transform enterprise service management.

## 1. Weekly Highlights

_This episode kicked off with the top news and updates in the Azure AI ecosystem:_

- GPT-5 and GPT-OSS Models Now in Azure AI Foundry: 
  Azure AI Foundry now supports OpenAI’s GPT-5 lineup (including GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, and GPT-5 Nano) and the new open-weight GPT-OSS models (120B, 20B). These models offer powerful reasoning, real-time agent tasks, and ultra-low latency Q&A, all with massive context windows and flexible deployment via the [Model Router](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/model-router).
- Flux 1 Context Pro & Flux 1.1 Pro from Black Forest Labs  
  These new vision models enable in-context image generation, editing, and style transfer, now available in the [Image Playground](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview) in Azure AI Foundry.
- **[Browser Automation Tool (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agent-service/):**  
  Agents can now perform real web tasks—search, navigation, form filling, and more—via natural language, accessible through API and SDK.
- **[GitHub Copilot Agent Mode + Playwright MCP Server](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-23-github-spark-in-public-preview-for-copilot-pro-subscribers/):**  
  Debug UIs with AI: Copilot’s agent mode now pairs with Playwright MCP Server to analyze, identify, and fix UI bugs automatically.
- **[Discord Community](https://aka.ms/model-mondays/discord):**  
  Join the conversation, share your feedback, and connect with the product team and other developers.

## 2. Spotlight On: Azure AI Agent Service & Agent Catalog

_This week’s spotlight was on building and orchestrating multi-agent workflows using the Azure AI Agent Service and the new Agent Catalog._

- **What is the Azure AI Agent Service?**  
  A managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling agentic AI solutions. It supports modular, multi-agent workflows, secure authentication, and seamless integration with Azure Logic Apps, OpenAPI tools, and more.  
  

- **Agent Catalog:**  
  A collection of open-source, ready-to-use agent templates and workflow samples. These include orchestrator agents, connected agents, and specialized agents for tasks like customer support, research, and more.  
  

- **Demo Highlights:**  
  - **Connected Agents:** Orchestrate workflows by delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents (e.g., mortgage application, market insights).
  - **Multi-Agent Workflows:** Design complex, hierarchical agent graphs with triggers, events, and handoffs (e.g., customer support with escalation to human agents).
  - **Workflow Designer:** Visualize and edit agent flows, transitions, and variables in a modular, no-code interface.
  - **Integration with Azure Logic Apps:** Trigger workflows from 1400+ external services and apps.

## 3. Customer Story: Atomic Work

_Atomic Work showcased how agentic AI can revolutionize enterprise service management, making employees more productive and ops teams more efficient._

- **Problem:**  
  Traditional IT service management is slow, manual, and frustrating for both employees and ops teams.
- **Solution:**  
  Atomic Work’s “Atom” is a universal, multimodal agent that works across channels (Teams, browser, etc.), answers L1/L2 questions, automates requests, and proactively assists users.
- **Technical Highlights:**  
  - **Multimodal & Cross-Channel:** Atom can guide users through web interfaces, answer questions, and automate tasks without switching tools.
  - **Data Ingestion & Context:** Regularly ingests up-to-date documentation and context, ensuring accurate, current answers.
  - **Security & Integration:** Built on Azure for enterprise-grade security and seamless integration with existing systems.
- **Demo:**  
  - Resetting passwords, troubleshooting VPN, requesting GitHub repo access—all handled by Atom, with proactive suggestions and context-aware actions.
  - Atom can even walk users through complex UI tasks (like generating GitHub tokens) by “seeing” the user’s screen and providing step-by-step guidance.

## Sharda's Tips: How I Wrote This Blog

Writing this blog is like sharing my own learning journey with friends. I start by thinking about why the topic matters and how it can help someone new to Azure or agentic AI. I use simple language, real examples from the episode, and organize my thoughts with GitHub Copilot to make sure I cover all the important points.

Here’s the prompt I gave Copilot to help me draft this blog:

> Generate a technical blog post for Model Mondays S2E9 based on the transcript and episode details. Focus on Azure AI Agent Service, Agent Catalog, and real-world demos. Explain the concepts for students, add a section on practical applications, and share tips for writing technical blogs. Make it clear, engaging, and useful for developers and students.

After watching the video, I felt inspired to try out these tools myself. The way the speakers explained and demonstrated everything made me believe that anyone can get started, no matter their background. My goal with this blog is to help you feel the same way—curious, confident, and ready to explore what AI and Azure can do for you. If you have questions or want to share your own experience, I’d love to hear from you.
